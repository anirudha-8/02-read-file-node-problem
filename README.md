# 🌟 Problem 2: Read Content from a File 🌟

Welcome to the second challenge of mastering Node.js! 🚀 In this problem, you'll learn how to work with the **fs (File System)** module to read content from a file. Get ready to dive deeper into Node.js! 💻

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Create a Node.js script that reads the content of a file and displays it in the console.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn to use Node.js's built-in `fs` module for file operations.
- Understand how to handle asynchronous file reading.
- Explore error handling when working with files.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Your project folder should look like this:

```bash
problem-2-file-reader/
├── example.txt       # The file to be read
├── readFile.js       # The script to read the file content
├── README.md         # Documentation for this problem
└── package.json      # Project configuration file
```

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you've completed the basics, try adding:

- **Synchronous Reading:** Experiment with fs.readFileSync.

- **Dynamic File Input:** Use process.argv to allow dynamic file names.

- **Error Logging:** Log errors into a separate file instead of the console.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to use the fs module for file operations.

- Differences between synchronous and asynchronous file handling.

- Error handling in Node.js for better resilience.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Move on to the next problem to learn more exciting Node.js concepts. 🎉
